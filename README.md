# Exploration and Analysis of US's Clinical Care of Diabetes-Diagnosed Patients
## Abstract
In modern world, despite improved clinical treatments for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.
## Overview
In this notebook, we explore and analyse the dataset represeting ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and intergrated delivery network. Each record concerns a patient who is diagnosed with diabetes and underwent laboratory, medications, and hospitalization of 14-day maximization. The goal of the notebook is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge.

The original datasets contains 101766 instances with 47 features including both categorical and integer types. The dataset can be obtained at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008
